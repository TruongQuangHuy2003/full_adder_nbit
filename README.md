### N-bit Full Adder Overview

An **N-bit Full Adder** is a combinational circuit designed to perform the addition of two N-bit binary numbers along with a carry input. It is constructed by cascading multiple single-bit full adders, allowing for efficient multi-bit binary addition.

#### Inputs:
- **A[N-1:0]**: First N-bit binary number.
- **B[N-1:0]**: Second N-bit binary number.
- **Cin**: Carry input for the least significant bit (LSB).

#### Outputs:
- **Sum[N-1:0]**: N-bit binary sum.
- **Cout**: Carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB).

### Construction Using Full Adders

An N-bit Full Adder is implemented by connecting \(N\) single-bit full adders in a cascaded fashion. Each full adder adds one bit from \(A\), one bit from \(B\), and the carry from the previous stage:

1. **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Adder**:
   - Inputs: \(A[0], B[0], Cin\)
   - Outputs: \(Sum[0], Carry[0]\)

2. **Intermediate Adders**:
   - For each \(i\) (1 â‰¤ \(i\) < \(N\)):
     - Inputs: \(A[i], B[i], Carry[i-1]\)
     - Outputs: \(Sum[i], Carry[i]\)

3. **Most Significant Bit (MSB) Adder**:
   - Inputs: \(A[N-1], B[N-1], Carry[N-2]\)
   - Outputs: \(Sum[N-1], Cout\)

#### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to any number of bits by adding more full adders.
- **Reusability**: Utilizes modular single-bit full adders, making the design easy to implement and debug.
